# _Spring Annotations_

Use this library to skip the processing of the requests generated by smoke tests for the upstream services
#Step to Use
1. Use Annotation on the entry method of events
2. write the value for `filterValue` as the name of service in which this annotation is used
3. write the value for `fieldToScan` as the name of field which is used for clientId(or requester)

For eg.,  
Suppose if we are using this annotation over any method named in which we want to check if the field named `designation` is specific as we want, then the Annotation will be used as below.  
`@AOPFilter(filterValue = "developer", fieldToScan = "designation")`
